The project monitors major new commercial and residential property development in the City of Melbourne municipality.

The outputs can inform short to medium-term supply forecasts in the commercial and residential markets. This data provides the current understanding of major development sites that are recently completed, under construction, planned or mooted in all of 13 small areas of the city.

Due to the number of developments active in the municipality, not all developments are tracked in the DAM. In general a development needs to meet one of the following conditions to be included in the Development Activity Monitor.
